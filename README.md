# dirty scripts
##### A collections of python scripts I write to faciliate my GIS work in the dirt lab

## samplr
The big-baby script(s).  This is a script to manage my samples and associated information.  
It (when completed) will do things like pull isotope information from the database, do certain GIS operations,
export data tables for analysis, maybe do some of the statistics itself, and maybe even make nice typsetted tables 
and graphs.

## scratch scripts
These are scripts that do various other things for my work in the dirtlab.  Sometimes they will be (attempts) at 
more general tools, sometimes they will be very situation specific.  Some of it is functionality that will be
eventually rolled into samplr.
